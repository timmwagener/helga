# AbcExport [options]
Options:
-h / -help  Print this message.

-prs / -preRollStartFrame double
The frame to start scene evaluation at.  This is used to set the
starting frame for time dependent translations and can be used to evaluate
run-up that isn't actually translated.

-duf / -dontSkipUnwrittenFrames
When evaluating multiple translate jobs, the presence of this flag decides
whether to evaluate frames between jobs when there is a gap in their frame
ranges.

-v / -verbose
Prints the current frame that is being evaluated.

-j / -jobArg string REQUIRED
String which contains flags for writing data to a particular file.
Multiple jobArgs can be specified.

-jobArg flags:

-a / -attr string
A specific geometric attribute to write out.
This flag may occur more than once.

-atp / -attrPrefix string (default ABC_)
Prefix filter for determining which geometric attributes to write out.
This flag may occur more than once.

-ef / -eulerFilter
If this flag is present, apply Euler filter while sampling rotations.

-f / -file string REQUIRED
File location to write the Alembic data.

-fr / -frameRange double double
The frame range to write.

-frs / -frameRelativeSample double
frame relative sample that will be written out along the frame range.
This flag may occur more than once.

-nn / -noNormals
If this flag is present normal data for Alembic poly meshes will not be
written.

-ro / -renderableOnly
If this flag is present non-renderable hierarchy (invisible, or templated)
will not be written out.

-rt / -root
Maya dag path which will be parented to the root of the Alembic file.
This flag may occur more than once.  If unspecified, it defaults to '|' which
means the entire scene will be written out.

-s / -step double (default 1.0)
The time interval (expressed in frames) at which the frame range is sampled.
Additional samples around each frame can be specified with -frs.

-sl / -selection
If this flag is present, write out all all selected nodes from the active
selection list that are descendents of the roots specified with -root.

-sn / -stripNamespaces (optional int)
If this flag is present all namespaces will be stripped off of the node before
being written to Alembic.  If an optional int is specified after the flag
then that many namespaces will be stripped off of the node name. Be careful
that the new stripped name does not collide with other sibling node names.

Examples: 
taco:foo:bar would be written as just bar with -sn
taco:foo:bar would be written as foo:bar with -sn 1

-u / -userAttr string
A specific user attribute to write out.  This flag may occur more than once.

-uatp / -userAttrPrefix string
Prefix filter for determining which user attributes to write out.
This flag may occur more than once.

-uv / -uvWrite
If this flag is present, uv data for PolyMesh and SubD shapes will be written to
the Alembic file.  Only the current uv map is used.

-wcs / -writeColorSets
Write all color sets on MFnMeshes as color 3 or color 4 indexed geometry 
parameters with face varying scope.

-wfs / -writeFaceSets
Write all Face sets on MFnMeshes.

-wfg / -wholeFrameGeo
If this flag is present data for geometry will only be written out on whole
frames.

-ws / -worldSpace
If this flag is present, any root nodes will be stored in world space.

-wv / -writeVisibility
If this flag is present, visibility state will be stored in the Alembic
file.  Otherwise everything written out is treated as visible.

-mfc / -melPerFrameCallback string
When each frame (and the static frame) is evaluated the string specified is
evaluated as a Mel command. See below for special processing rules.

-mpc / -melPostJobCallback string
When the translation has finished the string specified is evaluated as a Mel
command. See below for special processing rules.

-pfc / -pythonPerFrameCallback string
When each frame (and the static frame) is evaluated the string specified is
evaluated as a python command. See below for special processing rules.

-ppc / -pythonPostJobCallback string
When the translation has finished the string specified is evaluated as a
python command. See below for special processing rules.

Special callback information:
On the callbacks, special tokens are replaced with other data, these tokens
and what they are replaced with are as follows:

#FRAME# replaced with the frame number being evaluated.
#FRAME# is ignored in the post callbacks.

#BOUNDS# replaced with a string holding bounding box values in minX minY minZ
maxX maxY maxZ space seperated order.

#BOUNDSARRAY# replaced with the bounding box values as above, but in
array form.
In Mel: {minX, minY, minZ, maxX, maxY, maxZ}
In Python: [minX, minY, minZ, maxX, maxY, maxZ]

Examples:

AbcExport -j "-root |group|foo -root |test|path|bar -file /tmp/test.abc"
Writes out everything at foo and below and bar and below to /tmp/test.abc.
foo and bar are siblings parented to the root of the Alembic scene.

AbcExport -j "-frameRange 1 5 -step 0.5 -root |group|foo -file /tmp/test.abc"
Writes out everything at foo and below to /tmp/test.abc sampling at frames:
1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5

AbcExport -j "-fr 0 10 -frs -0.1 -frs 0.2 -step 5 -file /tmp/test.abc"
Writes out everything in the scene to /tmp/test.abc sampling at frames:
-0.1 0.2 4.9 5.2 9.9 10.2

Note: The difference between your highest and lowest frameRelativeSample can
not be greater than your step size.

AbcExport -j "-step 0.25 -frs 0.3 -frs 0.60 -fr 1 5 -root foo -file test.abc"

Is illegal because the highest and lowest frameRelativeSamples are 0.3 frames
apart.

AbcExport -j "-sl -root |group|foo -file /tmp/test.abc"
Writes out all selected nodes and it's ancestor nodes including up to foo.
foo will be parented to the root of the Alembic scene.
